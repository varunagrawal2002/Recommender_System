Trying to build various types of recommender system.

The course recommendation system utilizes MongoDB databases to provide personalized course recommendations.
The codes snippets connects to the database, retrieves course data, and encodes course descriptions using TF-IDF vectorization.
It generates recommendations based on similarity scores, allowing users to find relevant courses based on their queries.

The code snippets also retrieves user goals and existing skills from a survey database, compares them with the skills required
for their desired career role, and recommends courses to bridge the skill gap. By leveraging MongoDB and advanced techniques, 
the system streamlines course discovery and helps users find courses aligned with their goals and skill development needs.
